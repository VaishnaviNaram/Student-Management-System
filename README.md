# Student-Management-System
Managing and organizing student data is an essential aspect of any educational institution.

As the number of students increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of their records manually.

Therefore, a graphical user interface (GUI) for student database management can be a useful tool for schools, colleges, and universities.

A student database GUI provides a user-friendly interface to store, retrieve, and manipulate student data efficiently.

This system helps to automate many manual processes and provides a centralized platform to access student information quickly.

A student database GUI can be developed using various programming languages and frameworks such as Java, Python, and C#.

Here, I have implemented a student database GUI using JAVA and Swing. Java is a popular programming language, while Swing is a user interface toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Java applications.
